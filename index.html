		<h1>kcalTrax Support</h1>
		
		<h2 id="about">About</h2>
		<p>kcalTrax is an app designed to make it easy for you to track the calories you are consuming on a daily basis.</p>
		<p>The app includes a fully editable food database, a fully editable recipe database, a shopping list, reminder notifications and detailed statistics - all of these features are explained in detail below.</p>
		
		<h2 id="home">Home</h2>
		<p>This is the page that you land on upon opening the kcalTrax app, and can be considered as the central location of the application.</p>
		<div class="images">

		</div>
		<p>The top proportion of this page contains an overview of your current daily calorie intake. The progress circle indicates how many calories have been consumed so far in the day; when the blue circle gets completed you have met your goal - congratulations! Just below the progress circle is a reminder of your goal, another reminder of your current level of consumption, and how many calories you need to consume in order to meet your goal.</p>
		<p>The final item(s) displayed on the home screen are the items (both food and meals/recipes) which you have already logged in the day.</p>
		
		<h2 id="recipes">Recipes</h2>
		<h3>Recipe List</h3>
		<p>On this page of the kcalTrax app you can view all of the recipes which are stored within the application's database. </p>
		<p>Each recipe is displayed with its title, a brief description of the recipe, a picture of the finished product and the number of calories the recipe contains. Simply scroll through the list to find the recipe you want and click on it for more information.</p>
		<p>At the top of the page is a search feature. Here you can type in a recipe and the app will search through the database and return any matching results. By clicking the filter icon to the left of the search bar, you can add additional parameters to finetune your recipe search.</p>
		<h3>View Recipe</h3>
		<p>Once you click on a recipe, you will be navigated to that recipe's unique page.</p>
		<p>On this page you can see all of the details about that recipe - description, ingredients, method, calories, etc. Below the recipe details is a button to log the meal; when this button is pressed, the calories for one serving are added to your daily total.</p>
		<p>By pressing on the 'Add ingredients to shopping list' button the app will update your shopping list to contain all of the ingredients in the recipe you are viewing.</p>
		<h3>Edit Recipe</h3>
		<p>To edit a recipe, swipe from left to right on the recipe you wish to edit in order to reveal the hidden utility buttons. Click on the orange edit button and you will be navigated to the edit page for that recipe.</p>

		<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
		<h3>Food List</h3>
		<p>On this page of the kcalTrax app you can view all of the individual foods which are stored within the application's database.</p>
		<p>Each food is displayed with the name of the food, a brief description and the number of calories a serving of the food contains. Simply scroll through the list to find the food you want and click on it for more information.</p>
		<p>If yo swipe to the right on any food, you get the options to delete that food by pressing the delete button, or add that food to your shopping list by pressing the shopping cart button.</p>
		<p>At the top of the page is a search feature. Here you can type in a food and the app will search through the database and return any matching results. By clicking the filter icon to the left of the search bar, you can add additional parameters to finetune your food search.</p>
		<h3>Edit Food</h3>
		<p>To edit a food, swipe from left to right on the food you wish to edit in order to reveal the hidden utility buttons. Click on the orange edit button and you will be navigated to the edit page for that food.</p>
		<p>Here you can edit the information about a food! Simply make your changes in the appropriate fields and be sure to save your changes by clicking on the save changes button.</p>
		<h3>Add Food</h3>
		<p>This is the page in the kcalTrax app where you can add new food to the database.</p>
		<div class="images">
			<figure class="hidden_tablet">
				<img src="images/mobile/add_food_mobile.png" />
				<!--<figcaption>The kcalTrax settings page.</figcaption>-->
			</figure>
			<figure class="hidden_mobile">
				<img src="images/tablet/add_food_tablet.png" />
				<!--<figcaption>The kcalTrax settings page.</figcaption>-->
			</figure>
		</div>
		<p> There are two different ways of adding food. You can manually add the nutritional information by typing the information into the text fields, or you can choose to use the inbuilt barcode scanner functionality. By clicking on the 'launch barcode scanner' button, the app will use your device's camera as a barcode scanner.</p>
		<p>This food will now show up in the main food page!</p>
		
		<h2 id="shopping">Shopping List</h2>
		<p>The kcalTrax app also contains a built-in shopping list for your convenience.</p>
		<div class="images">
			<figure class="hidden_tablet">
				<img src="images/mobile/shopping_list_mobile.png" />
				<!--<figcaption>The kcalTrax shopping list page.</figcaption>-->
			</figure>
			<figure class="hidden_mobile">
				<img src="images/tablet/shopping_list_tablet.png" />
				<!--<figcaption>The kcalTrax shopping list page.</figcaption>-->
			</figure>
		</div>
		<p>To add an item to the list simply type the item you wish to add into the text field at the top of the page and click the plus button, or enter on your device. If you wish to remove an item from the shopping list, swipe from left-to-right on that item and tap the red delete button which appears.</p>
		<p>Another way to add items to your shopping list is through the 'Food' or 'Recipes' pages. When browsing either of these lists, swipe from left-to-right on a item and press the green 'add to shopping list' button which appears; if you do this on a recipe it will add all the necessary ingredients to your shopping list.</p>
		<p>Whilst you're out on your shopping trip, press the checkbox next to an item you've just picked up in order to 'cross it off' the list.</p>
		
		<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
		<p>The settings page of the kcalTrax is where you can alter the functionality to help the app meet your needs.</p>
		<div class="images">
			<figure class="hidden_tablet">
				<img src="images/mobile/settings_mobile.png" />
				<!--<figcaption>The kcalTrax settings page.</figcaption>-->

			<figure class="hidden_mobile">
				<img src="images/tablet/settings_tablet.png" />
				<!--<figcaption>The kcalTrax settings page.</figcaption>-->
			</figure>
		</div>
		<p>Notifications can be turned on or off using the checkbox. When notifications are enabled you have the option to set the times at which you tend to eat your daily meals, and thus the app will notify you to log your calories at an appropriate time.</p>
		<p>On this page you also have the option to reset the tutorials which are displayed when you first open the app should you wish to view them again.</p>
		
		<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>
		<p>The statistics page of the kcalTrax app acts as a basis for reviewing your calorie, and other, consumption information.</p>
		<p>On the top portion of the display you can view a graph which shows your calorie consumption over the past 7 days. The horizontal line on the graph corresponds to your personal calorie target so you can see how well you're doing at a glance. Be sure to swipe on this graph to view further information on another graph!</p>
		<p>Below the graph is a collection of facts which are gathered from the information you have provided in the kcalTrax app. Simply scroll through the list to learn some interesting insights to your eating habits!</p>
		
		<h2 id="profile">Profile</h2>
		<p>On the profile page you can view all of your relevant personal health information. The kcalTrax app uses the health data you input in order to calculate your base metabolic rate and advised calorie goal.</p>
		<div class="images">
			<figure class="hidden_tablet">
				<img src="images/mobile/profile_mobile.png" />

				<!--<figcaption>The kcalTrax profile page.</figcaption>-->

You can also edit the advised goal if you have personal goals you're working towards. Don't forget to press 'save changes' before you leave the page!</p>
		
		<h2 id="logging">Logging Calories</h2>
		<p>Logging calories can be done through the plus button on the bottom right of the screen, or through the 'Food' and 'Recipes' pages themselves.</p>

		<p>First press the plus button on the bottom right of the screen and then press the 'Scan Barcode' button, located at the top of the list. This action will launch your devices camera which you can use to point at the barcode of the food you wish to add. Providing you have a food in the app with a matching barcode, a dialog will appear where you can add your serving size and log the food.</p>
